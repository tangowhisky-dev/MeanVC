**MeanVC** is a lightweight and streaming zero-shot voice conversion system that enables real-time timbre transfer from any source speaker to any target speaker while preserving linguistic content. The system introduces a diffusion transformer with chunk-wise autoregressive denoising strategy and mean flows for efficient single-step inference.

## ✨ Key Features

-   **🚀 Streaming Inference**: Real-time voice conversion with chunk-wise processing.
-   **⚡ Single-Step Generation**: Direct mapping from start to endpoint via mean flows for fast generation.
-   **🎯 Zero-Shot Capability**: Convert to any unseen target speaker without re-training.
-   **💾 Lightweight**: Significantly fewer parameters than existing methods.
-   **🔊 High Fidelity**: Superior speech quality and speaker similarity.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Environment Setup

Follow the steps below to clone the repository and install the required environment.

```bash
# Clone the repository and enter the directory
git clone https://github.com/ASLP-lab/MeanVC.git
cd MeanVC

# Create and activate a Conda environment
conda create -n meanvc python=3.11 -y
conda activate meanvc

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Device Selection

By default, MeanVC automatically selects the best available device (CUDA > MPS > CPU). You can also set the device using the `MEANVC_DEVICE` environment variable:

```bash
# Use CUDA GPU
export MEANVC_DEVICE=cuda

# Use Apple Silicon GPU (MPS)
export MEANVC_DEVICE=mps

# Force CPU
export MEANVC_DEVICE=cpu

# Use specific GPU
export MEANVC_DEVICE=cuda:1
```

Alternatively, pass `--device` argument to inference/preprocessing scripts to override the default:

```bash
python src/infer/infer_ref.py --device mps --source-path ... --reference-path ...
```

### 2. Download Pre-trained Models

Run the provided script to automatically download all necessary pre-trained models.

```bash
python download_ckpt.py
```

This will download the main VC model, vocoder, and asr model into the `src/ckpt/` directories.

This will download the main VC model, vocoder, and asr model into the `src/ckpt/` directories.

The speaker verification model (`wavlm_large_finetune.pth`) must be downloaded manually from Google Drive.  Download the file from [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1-aE1NfzpRCLxA4GUxX9ITI3F9LlbtEGP/view).  Place the downloaded `wavlm_large_finetune.pth` file into the `src/runtime/speaker_verification/ckpt/` directory.


### 3. Real-Time Voice Conversion

This script captures audio from your microphone and converts it in real-time to the voice of a target speaker.

```bash
python src/runtime/run_rt.py --target-path "path/to/target_voice.wav"
```

-   `--target-path`: Path to a clean audio file of the target speaker. This voice will be used as the conversion target. An example file is provided at `src/runtime/example/test.wav`.

When you run the script, you will be prompted to select your audio input (microphone) and output (speaker) devices from a list.

### 4. Offline Voice Conversion

For batch processing or converting pre-recorded audio files, use the offline conversion script.

```bash
bash scripts/infer_ref.sh
```

Before running the script, you need to configure the following paths in `scripts/infer_ref.sh`:

-   `source_path`: Path to the source audio file or directory containing multiple audio files to be converted
-   `reference_path`: Path to a clean audio file of the target speaker (used as voice reference)
-   `output_dir`: Directory where converted audio files will be saved (default: `src/outputs`)
-   `steps`: Number of denoising steps (default: 2)


## 🏋️‍♀️ Training

To train the model on your own dataset, follow these steps.

### 1. Data Preprocessing

First, you need to extract Mel spectrograms, content features (BN), and speaker embeddings from your audio data.

```bash
# Set device for preprocessing (optional - defaults to auto-detect)
export MEANVC_DEVICE=cuda

# 1. Extract Mel spectrograms (10ms frame shift)
python src/preprocess/extrace_mel_10ms.py --input_dir path/to/wavs --output_dir path/to/mels

# 2. Extract content features (160ms window)
python src/preprocess/extract_bn_160ms.py --input_dir path/to/wavs --output_dir path/to/bns

# 3. Extract speaker embeddings
python src/preprocess/extract_spk_emb_wavlm.py --input_dir path/to/wavs --output_dir path/to/xvectors

# Or force specific device:
python src/preprocess/extrace_mel_10ms.py --input_dir path/to/wavs --output_dir path/to/mels --device mps
```

### 2. Prepare Data List

Create a file list (e.g., `train.list`) for training. Each line should follow this format:

```
# Format: utt|bn_path|mel_path|xvector_path|prompt_mel_path1|prompt_mel_path2|...
utterance_id_001|/path/to/bns/utt001.npy|/path/to/mels/utt001.npy|/path/to/xvectors/utt001.npy|/path/to/mels/prompt01.npy
```

### 3. Start Training

Modify the configurations in `script/train.sh` (e.g., data paths, model directory) and run the script.

```bash
bash script/train.sh
```
